        <p>The ‘Stadskantine’ is an innovative concept that you will begin to see more and more in Amsterdam. In ‘de Pijp’ do you find this restaurant where you order at the counter, and then moments later you pick up your order from the counter. However, it’s not a take-away restaurant, at the ‘Stadskantine’ you can relaxed eat your meal. That there is no control, has a big advantage. Everything at the ‘Stadskantine’ is very affordable.</p>

        <p>This coffee spot in the eastern part of Amsterdam is one of those favorites, because they serve coffee from White Label with all the tasty cakes, muffins and brownies. Made with local, organic products. But of course also because you can work a whole day can with ease here. The Interior bears to this: vintage school chairs, sturdy wooden tables, wall art. There is a really cosy, cosy atmosphere and the Wi-Fi, which works perfectly!

        <p>We are quite excited about this place! It is so homey that you feel yourself totally on your spot. They have tasty healthy snacks to keep your energy recharged. And there are several places you can enjoy with your laptop or books, but the most fun we find is the bar. That is a 'workbar' where you can sit with all your studymates to work. How fun!</p>
