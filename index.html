        <p>The ‘Stadskantine’ is an innovative concept that you will begin to see more and more in Amsterdam. In ‘de Pijp’ do you find this restaurant where you order at the counter, and then moments later you pick up your order from the counter. However, it’s not a take-away restaurant, at the ‘Stadskantine’ you can relaxed eat your meal. That there is no control, has a big advantage. Everything at the ‘Stadskantine’ is very affordable.</p>

        <p>Right next to the Amstelcampus: Wibautstraat number 7. The place where you can find the newest Coffeecompany! A spacious and bright place, with an almost equally large terrace. Study here, get in the lazy lounge or enjoy the sun and an iced latte outside.

        <p>This coffee spot in the eastern part of Amsterdam is one of those favorites, because they serve coffee from White Label with all the tasty cakes, muffins and brownies. Made with local, organic products. But of course also because you can work a whole day can with ease here. The Interior bears to this: vintage school chairs, sturdy wooden tables, wall art. There is a really cosy, cosy atmosphere and the Wi-Fi, which works perfectly!
